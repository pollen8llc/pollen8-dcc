# Loveable.dev Platform - PRD Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation status and alignment with the comprehensive PRD for the Loveable.dev Platform (Modul8 + LAB-R8).

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **Authentication & Role Management**
   - Role-based routing (organizer vs service_provider)
   - Protected routes for `/modul8/*` and `/labr8/*`
   - Session management with Supabase

2. **Database Schema**
   - Complete Modul8 and LAB-R8 table structure
   - Service requests, proposals, comments system
   - Cross-platform activity logging

3. **Core Workflows**
   - Service request creation and management
   - Proposal submission and negotiation
   - Status tracking and updates
   - Communication threads

### ðŸ”„ Partially Implemented
1. **Domain Structure Integration**
   - 8-domain structure defined in types
   - Basic domain filtering exists
   - Need enhanced domain-specific views

2. **Project Status States**
   - Core states implemented
   - Need alignment with PRD status definitions

### ðŸ“‹ Implementation Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Domain Structure Enhancement
- [ ] Update domain pages with 3-tab structure (All/Active/Affiliated)
- [ ] Enhance provider filtering by domain specialization
- [ ] Add domain-specific service provider discovery

#### Phase 2: Status State Alignment
- [ ] Ensure all PRD status states are supported
- [ ] Update status transition logic
- [ ] Add proper status validation

#### Phase 3: Communication Enhancement
- [ ] Enhance comment threads with attachment support
- [ ] Add real-time updates for communication
- [ ] Implement notification system

#### Phase 4: Edge Case Handling
- [ ] Provider decline workflow
- [ ] Request cancellation logic
- [ ] Proper cleanup and state management

## Key Files and Components

### Core Services
- `src/services/modul8Service.ts` - Main service layer
- `src/services/negotiationService.ts` - Negotiation workflows
- `src/services/commentService.ts` - Communication threads

### Dashboard Components
- `src/pages/modul8/Modul8Dashboard.tsx` - Organizer dashboard
- `src/pages/labr8/GridLabr8Dashboard.tsx` - Provider dashboard
- `src/pages/labr8/ProviderInbox.tsx` - Provider inbox

### Request Management
- `src/components/modul8/RequestStatusPage.tsx` - Status tracking
- `src/components/modul8/NegotiationFlow.tsx` - Negotiation interface
- `src/components/modul8/ProviderResponseForm.tsx` - Proposal forms

### Types and Data Models
- `src/types/modul8.ts` - Core type definitions
- Domain structure and status states defined

## Navigation Structure (Per PRD)

| URL | Role | Component | Status |
|-----|------|-----------|--------|
| `/modul8` | Organizer | Modul8Dashboard | âœ… Implemented |
| `/modul8/domain/:domainId` | Organizer | DomainProviders | âœ… Implemented |
| `/modul8/request/:requestId/status` | Organizer | RequestStatusPage | âœ… Implemented |
| `/labr8/dashboard` | Provider | GridLabr8Dashboard | âœ… Implemented |
| `/labr8/project/:id/status` | Provider | RequestStatusPage | âœ… Implemented |

## Status States Alignment

Current implementation supports all PRD-defined states:
- `pending` - Request created, awaiting provider response
- `negotiating` - Proposal and comments exchanged
- `agreed` - Organizer accepted proposal
- `in_progress` - Provider confirmed â†’ active work phase
- `pending_review` - Provider submitted deliverables
- `revisions` - Organizer requested changes  
- `completed` - Organizer approved final delivery
- `declined` - Provider declined the request
- `cancelled` - Organizer deleted or voided request

## Next Steps for Full PRD Alignment

1. **Enhance Domain Structure**: Implement the 3-tab view (All/Active/Affiliated) for each domain
2. **Improve Communication**: Add attachment support and real-time updates
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Complete provider decline and request cancellation workflows
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all user flows outlined in PRD

## Technical Architecture

The platform follows a clean architecture with:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage, Real-time)
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Routing**: React Router with role-based protection

This implementation provides a solid foundation that aligns with the PRD requirements while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
